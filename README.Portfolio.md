# Features

## Navigation
The Navigation was created using NavLinks to be able to visually indicate which page the user is currently on. The NavLink functionality was also used to style the Hero section on the Home page. This was done by growing the banner image size and making the website name descend and grow in size. 

## Home
The Home page includes a subtitle, a short about and a sample of projects, along with links to *view more* on the relevant pages. It also includes a call to action button that redirects to the Contact page.
The project sample on the Home page is a partial rendering of the Projects component and will reflect any changes made, as a result.

## Projects
The Project page consists of a grid with each cell showcasing a project image. When the image is hovered over, a text block with a description of the project appears and the project image. Eventually, clicking on each project will take the user to it's dedicated page.

# About
A simple page with an introduction about me and my skills. Icons are used for a visual representaion of my skills so that the user can see that information easily. 

# Contact
The Contact page has a short text to encourage the user to get in touch, a contact form and links to the other ways of contacting me.
